# Forum_AC_Quiz_Integration
This repo consists of documents and files of the Ananda College forum quiz integration.

Here we have developed an integration for the Ananda College forum. With this we have enabled for admins to submit question papers to the site with the answer sheet which is saved in an SQL database. Then after a user completes the question paper, the paper is marked and the score and the time taken for answering is saved in a another database which is then used to create a leaderboard considering the score and time taken.

Technologies Used:
  PHP,
  Javascript,
  HTML,
  CSS,
  SQL.
